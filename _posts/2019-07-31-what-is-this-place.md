**Welcome to my website, and to my blog in particular!**

My name is Aaron. I am a student on summer break. Through a joint degree program, I study computer science at Columbia University, and Talmud, a classical Jewish legal text, at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. I am also an aspiring space professional. This summer, I am interning at OneWeb through the Matthew Isakowitz Fellowship Program. 

I have no clue what the long-term format of these posts will be, or how often they'll come. I intend to focus in this "space" mainly on technologies I use, the roles I play in the space sector, and how I see the relationship between the two fields.

I figured that if I was thinking about technologies cogently, I might as well start trying to share those thoughts. They're certainly of minimal value if they stay mine alone. We are privileged today to live in an age where information flows at the speed of light. The information age has, directly and indirectly, done wonders for me as a student of computer science. I keep on hearing from people how incredible it is to have the data of the internet at my fingertips, and I am starting to really believe it. The internet has helped me learn to program, enabled me to participate in aerospace competitions, and was an underlying technology I leveraged last summer as an intern at NASA Langley Research Center. Part of living responsibly in this age, I think, is attempting to contribute in a meaningful way to that information. The sciences drive our understanding of the universe, and will improve it - but only if we share our InSight (see what I did there?) with everybody else!

You might have noticed a couple structural peculiarities up to this point. 
1. Why is title a question? I study Jewish legal texts, and frequently grapple with how to relate that to my secular studies and career aspirations. I haven't found a general solution yet, nor do I particularly hope to, but this blog provides me with a particular way to integrate them. The Talmud, which is a judicial rather than legislative text, is structured as a conversation among a number of Rabbinic authorities. Questions, and the methods that they employ to resolve them, are central to the Talmudic dialectic. To better reflect the role that this text has played in my studies so far, I intend to use a question to focus the topic of each blog post. 
2. What is going on with the first person/second person format? The first person/second person way of writing is likely less familiar to me as a writer than it is to you as a reader. It is also less strongly associated the Talmudic dialectic, which tends to pose hypothetical cases about a third person, akin to "John Doe" (though the text does use second person hypotheticals when teasing out the meanings of things, and some translations fill in missing sentence subjects in the first person). I am using that right now because this is an introduction to this place. I won't know if it will stick around, or not, until I write some more blog posts. I guess I'd better get on that.

If you want to start your own website using the technologies I am using, the blog component of this site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I use Markdown to author my posts.  [This is the link](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to the instructions that I followed, which include Jekyll set-up.
