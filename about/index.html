	<h1>About Me</h1>
  		<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
  			<p>My name is Aaron. I guess I don't really have one set way I would define myself.<p>
			  <p>I'm from the suburbs of Chicago, IL. I am a student at a couple schools in New York City, but in between I spent some time in Israel. People matter to me.</p>
			  <p>I like coding. I <strong>love</strong> space.</p>
			  <p>Some time ago, I applied for an opportunity to be part of a group. At our first meeting, we introduced ourselves based on a "fun fact" we submitted in our application. Everybody else had super intriguing facts - they'd climbed mountains, performed in bands, etc. Some seriously impressive stuff. When I was introduced, my fun fact was "this person's favorite marsupial is the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=quokka&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfzITT2ODjAhWEv1kKHR-oD7gQ_AUIESgB&biw=1536&bih=750">quokka</a>. On that day, I learned that I'm also bad at coming up with a "fun fact" about myself.</p>
		  <h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>
  			<p>This website exists to demonstrate my skills as a software developer. As I approach the end of my undergraduate degree, I hope to undertake more independent coding projects, which I will probably store on GitHub. Since I'm on the website anyways, it makes sense for me to present it nicely, and maybe also start sharing my thoughts about technology via a <a href="https://aaronpickard.github.io/blog/">blog</a>.</p>
		  <h2>Academic Background</h2>
			  <h3>Columbia University<h3>
				<p>At Columbia University, I study Computer Science. I am on the Applications Track. I have a particular interest in developing applications, and programming in general, in the context of the aerospace industry.</p>
			  	<p>Because I am also a student at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, I am a non-traditional student. This means that I interact with Columbia administratively through the School of General Studies.</p>
				  <h4>Interesting Courses</h4>
				  	<h5>MEIE 4810 Introduction to Human Spaceflight (Spring 2019)</h5>
				  		<p>This spring, I had the opportunity to take a course on human spaceflight with Professor Mike Massimino. The course consisted of lectures, homework, and a semester-long project that was meant to relate to human space exploration. My group thought it was really curious how popular additive manufacturing was as part of plans to explore Mars, but that nobody seemed particularly interested in figuring out how to use those additively manufactured products efficiently (measured by any metric). The most popular use of additive manufacturing that we found was the creation of bricks out of Martian soil. As part of an interdisciplinary team, I developed a path planning algorithm for a multi-tethered aerostat to use to pick up bricks and build a useful structure out of them. Using aerstats in construction is a novel concept. We called our concept <a href = "https://github.com/aaronpickard/JENGA">Project JENGA</a>, and put all the code and a lot of the documenation up on GitHub.</p>
				  	<h5>COMS 4111 Introduction to Databases (Fall 2018)</h5>
						<p>Last fall, I took a course about databases. Through it, I implemented my own relational database, wrote REST API calls to integrate a database with a website, studied a very simple database engine, and was exposed to NoSQL databases. I gained a sense of the importance of efficient data storage, and how that can make or break an application environment.</p>
				  	<h5>HSAM 2901 Data: Past, Present, Future (Spring 2018)</h5>
						<p>This was a really interesting class, taught jointly by a professor in Applied Math and a professor in History. It covered the history of data and its analysis, and its development both as a discipline and a practice. As we learned about each advancement in the field, we used Python to do similar operations on an analogous dataset. The course was helpful in considering ways that I might be able to relate the two degrees towards which I am working. It also  gave me an introduction to Python. It showed me the potential of the language to apply, manipulate, and visualize data in a way that creates meaning. Lastly, the course touched on the role of ethics in programming, which is an important topic that I have not been exposed to in other courses.</p>
		  	<h3>Jewish Theological Seminary of America</h3>
		  		<p>I am also a student at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (we call it "JTS"). I am pursuing a B.A. in Talmud, which is a legal text that is structured like a Socratic dialogue, and that forms the basis for Rabbinic Judaism. I am taking coursework in Talmud, more recent legal codes (all of which are judicial rather than legislative), Bible, Jewish History, Jewish Thought, Liturgy, and Hebrew. The courses are all taught from an academic perspective, rather than a religious one.</p>
