	<h1>About Me</h1>
  		<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
  			<p>My name is Aaron.<p>
			<p>I'm from the suburbs of Chicago, IL. I am presently a student at Columbia, and the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City.</p>
			<p>People matter to me.</p>
			<p>I like coding. I love space.</p>
			<p>Some time ago, I applied for an opportunity to be part of a group. At our first meeting, we introduced ourselves based on a "fun fact" we submitted in our application. Everybody else had super intriguing facts - they'd climbed mountains, performed in bands, etc. Some seriously impressive stuff. When I was introduced, my fun fact was "this person's favorite marsupial is the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=quokka&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfzITT2ODjAhWEv1kKHR-oD7gQ_AUIESgB&biw=1536&bih=750">quokka</a>. On that day, I learned that I'm also bad at coming up with a "fun fact" about myself.</p>
		  <h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>
  			<p>This website exists to demonstrate my skills as a software developer. As I approach the end of my undergraduate degree, I hope to undertake more independent coding projects, which I will probably store on GitHub. At least one of those projects will hopefully be an exploration into front-end development. Since I'm on GitHub anyways, it makes sense for me to present my work here nicely, and maybe also start sharing my thoughts about technology via a <a href="https://aaronpickard.github.io/blog/">blog</a>.</p>
		  <h2>Academic Background</h2>
			<p><strong>Columbia University</strong></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>At Columbia University, I study Computer Science. I am on the Applications Track. I have a particular interest in developing applications, and programming in general, in the context of the aerospace industry.</p>
			  	<p>Because I am also a student at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, I am a non-traditional student. This means that I interact with Columbia administratively through the School of General Studies.</p>
				<strong>Interesting Courses</strong>
				<blockquote>
				  	<p><strong>MEIE 4810 Introduction to Human Spaceflight (Spring 2019)</strong> This spring, I had the opportunity to take a course on human spaceflight with Professor Mike Massimino. The course consisted of lectures, homework, and a semester-long project that was meant to relate to human space exploration. My group thought it was really curious how popular additive manufacturing was as part of plans to explore Mars, but that nobody seemed particularly interested in figuring out how to use those additively manufactured products efficiently (measured by any metric). The most popular use of additive manufacturing that we found was the creation of bricks out of Martian soil. As part of an interdisciplinary team, I developed a path planning algorithm for a multi-tethered aerostat to use to pick up bricks and build a useful structure out of them. Using aerostats in construction is a novel concept. We called our concept <a href = "https://github.com/aaronpickard/JENGA">Project JENGA</a>, and put all the code and a lot of the documenation up on GitHub. </p>
					<p><strong>COMS 4111 Introduction to Databases (Fall 2018)</strong> Last fall, I took a course about databases. Through it, I implemented my own relational database, wrote REST API calls to integrate a database with a website, studied a very simple database engine, and was exposed to NoSQL databases. I gained a sense of the importance of efficient data storage, and how that can make or break an application environment. </p>
				  	<p><strong>HSAM 2901 Data: Past, Present, Future (Spring 2018)</strong> This was a really interesting class, taught jointly by a professor in Applied Math and a professor in History. It covered the history of data and its analysis, and its development both as a discipline and a practice. As we learned about each advancement in the field, we used Python to do similar operations on an analogous dataset. The course was helpful in considering ways that I might be able to relate the two degrees towards which I am working. It also  gave me an introduction to Python. It showed me the potential of the language to apply, manipulate, and visualize data in a way that creates meaning. Lastly, the course touched on the role of ethics in programming, which is an important topic that I have not been exposed to in other courses. </p>

		  	<p><strong>Jewish Theological Seminary of America</strong></p>
				<blockquote>
		  		<p>I am also a student at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (we call it "JTS"). I am pursuing a B.A. in Talmud, which is a legal text that is structured like a Socratic dialogue, and that forms the basis for Rabbinic Judaism. I am taking coursework in Talmud, more recent legal codes (all of which are judicial rather than legislative), Bible, Jewish History, Jewish Thought, Liturgy, and Hebrew. The courses are all taught from an academic perspective, rather than a religious one.</p>

		  <h2>Extracurricular Activities & Hobbies</h5>
	<p><strong>Columbia Space Initiative <a href = "columbiaspace.org">(CSI)</a></strong> is a group of students at Columbia University who really enjoy space. It runs a number of technical and non-technical projects. I have been involved since the fall of my freshman year, in a variety of technical and non-technical roles.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Revolutionary Aerospace Systems Concepts - Academic Linkage (<a href = "http://rascal.nianet.org/">RASC-AL</a>)</strong> is where I got my start in the organization, both as a member and as a leader. I joined the group in Fall 2016, and had the pleasure of leading it from Spring 2017-Fall 2018. The project submits a design to RASC-AL, a NASA-backed systems engineering architecture responding to one of several design prompts. The three years I participated, we designed a commercially viable space station (2016), a Deep Space Transport (2017), and a lunar lander to be based at the Gateway(2018). The 2016 and 2017 entries were finalists in the competititon, and the 2018 entry was a semifinalist. My team's Deep Space Transport design was developed collaboratively with a team from the University of Minnesota that worked on a propellant resupply capability for our design, and our teams were the only paired designs that were recognized as finalists. The project taught me how to think about systems architecting. I also learned about high-level systems engineering concepts, like risk matrices, program schedules, design reviews, and the all-important trade study. </p>
		<p>I was also the <strong>Operations Director</strong> for the 2018-2019 academic year. In this role, I supported technical projects by taking the lead on developing fundraising materials, planning programs, and building institutional relationships. I planned the second CSI Hackathon, and continued the club's tradition of holding an annual technical showase.</p>

	<p>I am actively involved with <strong>Zeta Beta Tau (<a href = "http://zbtcolumbia.squarespace.com/">ZBT</a>)</strong>, one of the fraternities at Columbia. I take an active role in the organization, trying to be the change I wish to see in the Greek community. My vision for a fraternity today is a diverse group of young people contributing to their university community, and making it more fun. To that end, I am the Standards Director (which is similar to a Judicial Chair) this year. Last year, I sat on the Standards Board. When the Chapter's Constitution needed revising during my sophomore year, I participated in that process. Through ZBT, I found a community of like-minded people from diverse backgrounds, with whom I enjoy spending free time. I also found <a href = "https://columbiabarnardhillel.org/student-group/challah-for-hunger/">Challah for Hunger</a>, which is a highlight of my week, through the group.</p>
	<p>I enjoyed Columbia's New Student Orientation Program so much that I decided to come back as an <strong>Orientation Leader</strong>, and then I decided to do it again! Helping my new classmates adjust to what it means to be a student at Columbia is important to me. I see it as paying it forward to the Orientation Leaders that introduced me to the School of General Studies, and a fun transition back into the academic year. My new classmates are always interesting people, and it is a pleasure spending the last week of my summer getting to know them! It also helps build an academic community, which is something that I try to build throughout the year. I informally do <strong>student academic advising</strong> for my peers in the Joint Program. I work with them to help them pick classes that will meet their needs in terms of their intended majors, timing, anticipated graduation date, and other requirements they may have, so they can go into course planning meetings with their advisors with a plan. I say that I do it informally because the website indicating that I am available to help my classmates with this seems to be down.</p>
	<p>Absurdist debate is also a passion of mine. I am a full member of the <a href = "http://www.columbia.edu/cu/philo/">Philolexian Society</a>, one of the oldest absurdist debate groups in the country. I try to go to at least couple Philolexian Society meetings a semester. I also try to attend as many meetings as possible of Mockloket, an absurdist debate group that meets less regularly at the Columbia/Barnard Hillel to discuss absurd religious topics.</p>
	<p><strong>TAMID Group</strong> is a club on campus dedicated to learning about investing and consulting in the context of Israel. I participated in their education program in Fall 2016, co-led a consulting engagement in Spring 2017, and participted in a stock pitch competition in Fall 2018.</p>
		  <h2>Aspirations</h2>
		  	<p>"When I grow up...", I want to work in the space industry. In the short term, it'd be nice to apply the skillset I've been developing for the past four years, and write code. In the medium- to long-term, I do not know exactly what I'd like to see myself doing, but I know that I like working with both people and technology, and that I want to go to bed every night knowing two things:
<ol>
	<li>I worked hard today.</li>
	<li>I made the world a better place today.<li>
	</ol>
I firmly believe that the space sector is the best place to do this.</p>
